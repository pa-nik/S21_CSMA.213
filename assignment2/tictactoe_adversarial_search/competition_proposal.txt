My competition proposal/idea can be assistance to 
the visually impaired where it can be a OCR/screen 
reading with AI included into for easy accessing/viewing 
the computer. 

Second, competition proposal/idea 
can be drive-through 
Spring showcase / graduation, 
where cars are detected and 
tracked and we have a wall 
projection that responds to 
the viewpoint of the car as it drives by.
